# ISN-Final

This is just a little platformer that was my group project in 12th Grade 
but we never get to finish it so now that I have more knowledge about Python I decide to give it an other try.

The objective is quite simple:

You have to jump from platforms to an other to reach the top one.

It will challenge me to understand how to deal with gravity, class, methods and make a good looking interface
